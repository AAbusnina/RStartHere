Runners Up
----------

We know of people that recommend these packages. We haven't included them in our [main list](README.md) because they do not meet one or more of our criteria for a useful R package:

-   The code in the package runs fast, with few errors.
-   The code in the package has an intuitive syntax that is easy to remember.
-   The package plays well with other packages; you do not need to munge your data into new forms to use the package.
-   The package is widely used and recommended by its users.
-   The package has a development website, or series of vignettes, that make the package easy to learn.
-   The package is developed in the open (e.g. on Github or RForge).
-   The package uses tests to ensure that it will be stable and bug free well into the future.
-   The package is stable and available from CRAN, or we are personally involved with the package and committed to its development.
